## Frequency of the first letter

What is the most frequent first letter among all English words? How about the least one?

I made a plot here, which shows the most frequent first letter is S, and the lesat frequent one is X.

## Frequency of the consecutive letters

This part is based on python, so if you'd like to download and run the .py and Makefile, you have to download [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) first.

What is the most frequent letter after A among all the English words? How about the most frequent letter after B? How about C and etc ? 

I made a dataframe which shows the frequency of each letter after A to Z. Here, I made three plots, showing the results for A, B and C.
