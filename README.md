## Frequency of the first letter

What is the most frequent first letter among all English words? How
about the least one?

I made a plot here, which shows the most frequent first letter is S, and
the lesat frequent one is X.

## Frequency of the consecutive letters

This part is based on python, so if youâ€™d like to download and run the
.py and Makefile, you have to download
[python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) first.

What is the most frequent letter after A among all the English words?
How about the most frequent letter after B? How about C and etc ?

I made a dataframe which shows the frequency of each letter after A to
Z. Here, I made three plots, showing the results for A, B and C.
